    "The year 2020 is coming to an end and Santa is preparing for Christmas. However, this year the Elves made too many gifts and Santa can't take all of them with him at once: the total of his sleigh has to be below below a certain threshold so that his reindeer are still able to pull the sleigh around the world. Therefore, Santa needs to carefully choose the gifts to take so that his sleigh is not overloaded and the amount of happiness he brings to the world is as large as possible. (The remaining gifts will be delivered by other means.) Santa asked you for help with this task.\n",
